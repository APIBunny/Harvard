Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi there,

You'll find a very basic Website. I have implemented every request of yours. 
From my main page you have three links to the different pages: list, table and image.

I have used bootstrap on the image.html - you will see pictures of me doing three different jobs.
table.html - here you will see a table with magic properties.
list.html - here you will see two kinds of lists.
index.html - this is the mainhub from where you can navigate to the other pages.

I have rendered my .scss file online here: https://www.sassmeister.com/
